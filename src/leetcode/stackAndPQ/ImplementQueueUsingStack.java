/**
 * LeetCode 232
 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

	push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
	pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
	peek() -- Get the front element.
	empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
	Notes:
	You must use only standard operations of a stack 
		-- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
	
	Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. 
		You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), 
		as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
	
	You may assume that all operations are valid 
		(for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
